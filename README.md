3. Update the installscript to final
4. Update dependencies
5. Create package

# LCDPROC

I did not write nor contribute to lcdproc, so all credits go to them for enabling me to use it.

You can test your LCD by calling lcdproc to print CPU info, note that it is a capital C.

$ lcdproc C

# MPDLCD

Same as lcdproc, all credits go to the mpdlcd development team. You can start mpdlcd manually after installation to test its functionality.

$ mpdlcd
